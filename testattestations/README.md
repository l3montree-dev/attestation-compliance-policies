# Test Attestations generated by DevGuard


The test attestations have the following predicateType, when generated by the devguard attest github reusable workflow or gitlab ci cd component:

- `sarif.json`: `https://www.schemastore.org/schemas/json/sarif-2.1.0.json`
- `vex.json`: `https://cyclonedx.org/vex`
- `sbom.json`: `https://cyclonedx.org/bom`
- `slsa-build-provenance.json`: `https://slsa.dev/provenance/v1`

The json files only include the payload. Not the full attestation envelope. DevGuard is able to handle raw payload attestations and dead simple signing envelopes.
