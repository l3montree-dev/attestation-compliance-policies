## Introduction

In modern software development, ensuring security and compliance is not just a best practiceâ€”itâ€™s a necessity. Compliance as Code automates security and compliance checks by embedding them directly into the development lifecycle. This approach ensures that the software meets predefined security and policy requirements before deployment.

TL;DR: Our vision with this feature is to provide an easy way to define security and compliance policies and check your software like a pre-flight checklist before deployment.
